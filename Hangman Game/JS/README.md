# Hangman Game

This is a part of 1 Project with multiple languages where I will try to make a project with the languages I know.
<br/>
This is so that I dont get bored of one particular languages and to just revise the different languages
<br/>
I have done this with Python and C++
<br/>
Like the previous one the focus was to complete it in a day, not on clean code, but I tried to write clean code. Although wont be surprised if someone says "What a pathetic code :)"
<br/>
